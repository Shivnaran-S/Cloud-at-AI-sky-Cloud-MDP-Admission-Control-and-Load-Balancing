## 📌 **Project Overview**

**Cloud at AI Sky** is a research-driven project that optimizes resource management in cloud computing environments. Inspired by [Feldman et al. (2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236964785_Using_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_to_Optimize_Admission_Control_in_Cloud_Computing_Environment), it combines:

- **MDP Modeling** for dynamic resource allocation  
- **Dynamic Programming-Driven Admission Control** for revenue optimization  
- **Load Balancing Algorithms** for efficient resource utilization  

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### 1. Markov Decision Process (MDP) Modeling
- Captures cloud infrastructure states (VM deployments, pending requests)  
- Defines actions: admit/reject requests based on resource constraints  

### 2. Bellman Equation-Driven Admission Control
- Prioritizes high-revenue VM deployments  
- Maximizes long-term revenue while respecting resource limits  

### 3. Load Balancing
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Allocates to most underutilized nodes

## 🧬 **Methodology**

### 1. Continuous-Time MDP Framework
- Models cloud environment as CTMDP  
- States track active deployments + pending requests  
- Transition probabilities account for arrivals/departures  

### 2. Dynamic Programming Optimization
- Solves Bellman equation for value functions  
- Derives optimal admission policies  

### 3. Resource Allocation Strategies
- Capacity-aware placement decisions  
- Real-time load balancing
